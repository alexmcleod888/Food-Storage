Purpose: A redo of the Curtin 2018 Object Oriented Program Design (COMP1001) Assignment.
         The task was to design a program using java that manages items of food, 
         classifying them appropriately, and organising their storage accordingly. 
         Handling any errors as necessary.
         User has the ability to:
            - Add food to storage.
            - Remove food from storage.
            - Display the contents of storage locations.
            - Find expired foods.
            - read in a storage file (an example food file is given in resources).
            - read out storage to a file.
            - exit the program.
